####
# Configuration for the Leaderboard menu
# The global page defines "default" settings that will be used for a page, but will be overridden by any specific page section
#
# Page specific items will also inherit from the global page, so you don't have to copy paste everything
#
# Context specific placeholders:
# {page_number} - the page number
# {gui_opener} - the name of the player that opened the gui
#
# For this menu, any free slots will be filled with player skulls of the players in the leaderboard.
# if you want a slot to be empty, just define an item with type AIR
