##
# Arena configuration
#
# Every arena must have a different world
# Arena permissions do not have to be unique
#
# If a priority is not defined, 0 is used
# Higher numbers have higher priority
#
# Note that this configuration requires a server restart to update. It will NOT live-reload
#
# playable-area: The world border will form around this area and chests will only be placed in this area
